# Chronic-Kidney-Disease-Prediction


This project predicts the presence of **Chronic Kidney Disease (CKD)** using machine learning techniques. It analyzes patient data to identify individuals at risk, helping improve early detection and treatment outcomes.

## Features

✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing  
✅ Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
✅ Machine learning model training (e.g. Logistic Regression, Random Forest, etc.)  
✅ Model evaluation with metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score  
✅ Prediction on new patient data

## Dataset

- The dataset used contains medical attributes relevant for CKD diagnosis, including:
  - Age
  - Blood pressure
  - Specific gravity
  - Albumin
  - Sugar
  - Blood urea
  - Serum creatinine
  - Hemoglobin
  - Packed cell volume
  - White blood cell count
  - Red blood cell count
  - …and more.

*(Dataset source may vary: UCI Machine Learning Repository or other clinical datasets)*

## Requirements

Install required Python libraries:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn


How to Run the Notebook
Clone or download the repository.

Open Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook
Navigate to the project folder and open:

Chronic kidney disease.ipynb
Run each cell in order to:

Load the dataset

Explore and visualize data

Train machine learning models

Evaluate model performance

Make predictions

Example Workflow
Load and inspect the data.

Clean missing or inconsistent values.

Visualize correlations and important features.

Split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Train classification models such as Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, or Random Forest.

Evaluate using metrics like accuracy and confusion matrix.

Predict CKD status for new patient data.

Results
The notebook reports performance metrics, helping identify the most effective model for CKD prediction.

Models can be further fine-tuned or deployed for clinical applications.
